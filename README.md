# Hi, I'm Anıl 👋

Mathematics graduate specializing in AI/ML engineering. I build production-ready deep learning systems with a focus on computer vision, NLP, and retrieval-augmented generation.

## Featured Projects

**🤖 [GitHub RAG Chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/knightscode139/github-portfolio-chatbot)**
RAG system that answers questions about my GitHub repositories. Uses ChromaDB for vector storage, sentence-transformers for embeddings, and Claude Haiku for generation.

**💬 [IMDB Sentiment Classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/knightscode139/imdb-sentiment-classifier)**
Fine-tuned transformer model achieving 92.8% accuracy on sentiment classification.

**🩺 [COVID-19 X-Ray Classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/knightscode139/covid-xray-classifier)**
Transfer learning model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays with 92% accuracy. Built with PyTorch and deployed on HuggingFace Spaces.
