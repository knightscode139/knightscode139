# Hi, I'm Anıl 👋

AI/ML Engineer with strong mathematical foundations. I build production systems from scratch - from implementing transformer architecture in NumPy to fine-tuning 7B parameter model with LoRA.

## 🚀 Active Development

**[Ubuntu System Repair Agent](https://github.com/knightscode139/ubuntu-system-repair-agent)** 🔧 *Work in Progress*  
Multi-agent system for autonomous Ubuntu troubleshooting and repair. Built with LangGraph and MCP servers.
- **Architecture:** 3 specialized agents (Detector → Fixer → Executor) with supervisor coordination
- **Stack:** LangGraph • FastMCP • Ollama (local LLMs)
- **Goal:** Genuine utility tool for Ubuntu users, not just a portfolio piece
- Open to collaborators!
